  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a Bengaluru-based <strong>AI Data Analyst & Data Engineer</strong> with a passion for building intelligent
    systems.
    Currently, I specialize in <strong>Agentic AI</strong>, designing autonomous workflows where AI agents collaborate
    to solve complex problems—from automating data analysis to generating actionable business insights.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-1">
    My background is rooted in robust Data Engineering. At <strong>Kyndryl Solutions</strong>, I spent years sculpting
    resilient data pipelines, transforming raw, billion-row logs into pristine dashboards that executive leadership
    relies on for critical decision-making. I have a deep drive for optimization, having slashed data processing times
    and automated countless manual reporting hours.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-1">
    I am currently pursuing my <strong>Master of Computer Applications (MCA)</strong> at Jain University to further
    solidify my theoretical foundations while applying them in real-world AI applications. When I'm not coding or
    exploring the latest in LLMs and RAG, I enjoy solving algorithmic challenges and staying ahead of the rapidly
    evolving tech landscape.
